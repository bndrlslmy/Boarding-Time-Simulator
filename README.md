## Overview
This project aims to create a Java-based simulation to model and predict the boarding times of 180 passengers onto an airplane. The simulation categorizes passengers into two distinct types: solo passengers and those with special needs, providing insights into how different boarding strategies affect overall boarding time. In the first phase, passengers board at random without any predetermined order, which serves as a control for boarding efficiency. The second phase introduces an optimized boarding process that prioritizes special needs passengers and organizes the boarding by seat proximity to the windows to minimize aisle congestion and interference delays. The simulation will utilize Java for the underlying algorithmic logic and JavaFX to create a graphical user interface (GUI), allowing for a visual and interactive representation of both boarding scenarios. The project's outcome is to analyze and compare the two methods, presenting data on which strategy yields a faster and more efficient boarding process.


## Features
- Real-time simulation of boarding scenarios for a full-capacity 180-passenger airplane.
- Passenger categorization for a more organized boarding approach, featuring:
  - Solo travelers
  - Passengers with special needs
- A two-phased boarding simulation approach:
  - **Random Boarding Phase**: Simulates an unstructured boarding scenario with passengers entering the aircraft at random.
  - **Optimized Boarding Phase**: Implements a planned seating strategy prioritizing special needs passengers and systematically filling window seats first to optimize boarding time.

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **GUI**: JavaFX for creating a user-friendly interface.
- **Build Tool**: The project is packaged as a JAR file for easy distribution and execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the Boarding Time Simulator, ensure you have the following software installed:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 8 or newer.
- JavaFX SDK - Make sure it is compatible with the installed version of JDK.
